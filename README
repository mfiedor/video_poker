This is a written by hand video poker game.

Anyone can improve on this by:


1. implement game saving/loading
2. a tk preferences window 
3. clean up the code
4. prevent the player from pressing Replay until he gets a good hand dealt to him 
5. making sure the program prevents playing with zero money.


I have moved onto other projects, and may come back to this one. 

This is the first actual program that I have written, albeit incomplete.
